#+TITLE: HPI: Fission talk

* HPI


* TODO Demonstrations

* TODO Modules

* TODO programmatic API is very important

* Features
- local-first (actually fully offline!)
** TODO enriching data (e.g. timezone provider)

* One-way

TODO
It's not strictly necessary, but this seems like a much much harder problem.

* TODO some diagram
link to myinfra


* Design
** TODO synthetic exports?

* Prior art

* Why?

** quantified self
We have lots of data, yet no insight from it.
# perhaps except the 'insight' big tech gets for ads purposes
Imagine if you could have a system which automatically finds interesting correlations and TODO

** local/offline interfaces
- orger

** siphons

** dead services
- endomondo
** migrating/lock-in protection
-

** memex

* Databases suck
** choosing schema is hard
** not everything fits into the relational model
** migrations are hard

* Architecture?
- TODO namespace packages
- TODO mention elisp ?

** TODO config?
** extending
** TODO cachew?
currently sqlite, but maybe in postgres/redis?
thanks to SqlAlchemy might be almost trivial

* Data flow?

* Why Python?

- mypy

* Error handling

Very important!
mypy :heart:
TODO example of 'opt-in' error handling?

* Storage
- how much space it takes?
- syncing
- bleanser?


* Integrations

* What's hard/unsolved?
- how to scale/extend?
  # I can't properly maintain
  Sort of an Emacs problem
- versioning?
  kind of the same problem
  # completely unclear -- changes all the time
  # at least with code it's possible to keep it backwards compatible & test
- where to get test data?
  # would be nice if services provided test data/test API endpoints
